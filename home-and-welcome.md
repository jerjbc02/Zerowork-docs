# Home and Welcome

ZeroWork is dedicated to creators who want to build TaskBots that automate repetitive tasks such as typing, clicking and copy-pasting data in the browser.

TaskBots are designed to mimic human interactions on any website by clicking buttons, saving text, and more. They act like real human users! This enables automation without limits. ðŸš€

No coding required.
